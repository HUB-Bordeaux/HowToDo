First choose the type of activity, here `Talk` or `Workshop`.

Set `Number of sessions` to 1.

Click on the field next to `Number` and **do not** change the number inside.

Select the `Start` and `End` date. Set the `End` date to a long date after the session so you are able to change a session planned if needed (we will see after).

Select the `Duration of the activity`.

For Talk/Workshop their is no `Associated Project`, `Associated time-slots` and `Mark Associated`.

Check `Subscribe to planned activity ?` so the students can register themselves to the activity.

For example `[TALK]` and maybe `/!\TEK1 ONLY/!\` if needed.

Paste the activity's description.

Do not change the `Number of activities`.
